# Race, Gender and, Age Bias in Outcomes of NYPD Complaints
Our approach to one of the assignments for DSC 80 (Practice of Data Science) at UCSD. Contains Jupyter notebooks with code and markdown which walks the reader through our findings.

## Files
`eda.ipynb` Contains exploratory data analysis portion of assignment.

`modelling.ipynb` Contains modeling portion of the assignment.

## Overview
**Dataset:** Includes more than 12,000 civilian complaints filed against NYPD police officers from 1985 to early 2020, available to NYC's Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). Complaints included are only those of officers still on the force as of late June 2020, as well as those which were confirmed to have actually happened. Regardless, not all complaints were ruled to have violated the NYPD's rules of conduct.

The data also includes demographic information about the complainants and the officers in each case, as well as the type and outcome of the complaints.

**Objective:** We intend to use the demographic information provided in conjunction with the outcomes of each case in order to investigate if gender played a role in the validation of a complainantâ€™s case.
